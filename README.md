# React TreeGrid

Thoughts:

- Phase 1: Grid has many cells
- Phase 2: A list of grids is a "table"
- Phase 3: A tree has a grid and a list of trees

Undecided technical questions:

- Should `renderNode` be a function (i.e. render prop) or a React Pure Function (i.e. an element)?
  - What are the pros and cons of each?
- Will the grid -> tree terminology stand the test of time?
